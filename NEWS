geojsonio 0.1.4
===============

NEW FEATURES

* New function `map_leaf()` uses the `leaflet` package to make maps, with
S3 methods for most spatial classes as well as most R classes, including
data.frame's, lists, vectors, file inputs, and more (#48)
* `geojson_read()` now optionally can give back a spatial class object,
just a convenience in case you want to not get back geojson, but a
spatial class (#60)

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Now that `leaflet` R package is on CRAN, put back in examples using
it to make maps (#49)
* Added a linter for list inputs comined with `geometry="polygon"` to
all `geojson_*()` functions that have `.list` methods. This checks to
make sure inputs have the same first and last coordinate pairs to
close the polygon (#34)

BUG FIXES

* Importing all non-base R funtions, including from `methods`, `stats` and `utils`
packages (#62)
* Fixed bug in `geojson_write()` in which geojson style names were altered
on accident (#56)
